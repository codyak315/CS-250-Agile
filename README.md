Sprint Review and Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

One of the biggest strengths a programmer can have is the ability to take a large problem and break it down into smaller ones. This applies not only to code but to translating the problem from standard english into an actionable list of programming tasks. In order to make sure you are implementing what the client wants and needs it pays to be organized, enter: user stories. User stories are a great way of presenting an idea or a feature from the perspective of the end user, creating a direct line from the wants of an end-user to the programmer. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Software development is a team effort. Dividing the work into manageable pieces and constant communication are key to delivering a quality project in a timely manner. Communication cannot be understated, and as I continue down the software development path I look forward to participating in scrum, particularly daily meetings which I feel is a great structure of a forum to promote communication. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

While the first thing that comes to mind is simply "being good at your job" that is a very shallow view of working in the software development field. As projects are rarely if ever done solo it is important that you are on the same page with you co-workers, that you are consistent and reliable. If you find yourself stumbling on a task you are not afraid to speak up and seek help instead of sitting on it and potentially wasting everyones time that could be waiting on your piece to move forwards themselves. If you happen to be a rockstar of a programmer, you make yourself available to help others. In general being a good team member is all about being an effective communicator and utilizing your strengths while shoring up your fellow members weaknesses, as they do the same for you.
